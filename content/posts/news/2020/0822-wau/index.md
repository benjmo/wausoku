wau! A brand new website!

This site is intended to be used by the communities of the game _Touhou Hisoutensoku (東方非想天則)_, labelled as the 12.3rd game in the Touhou Project.

For now, it is pretty barebones, with the main aim of the site being to host some information from the Oceania server to improve accessibility and navigatability.
However, the site is not restricted to the Oceanic community, and is intended to be open to all soku players regardless of region.

Check back soon to see more stuff, improved visuals and how you can contribute your own content to the site! 🙂
